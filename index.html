			Federated learning trains a global model distributedly by aggregating local agents’ models; therefore, some malicious agents can inject backdoors in local models to attack the global model, referred to as distributed backdoors. In this study, my objective is to determine whether the traditional approach for centralized backdoor defense works on defending distributed backdoors. I reproduced the Model Poisoning attack, a representative pixel-patterned distributed backdoor attack against federated learning proposed by A. N. Bhagoji et al. (2019) on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. I further testified the effectiveness of Neural Cleanse, a generic defense against centralized backdoors proposed by B. Wang et al. (2019), by running Neural Cleanse on the poisoned models. The result of Neural Cleanse is false-positive, which demonstrates that Neural Cleanse as an effective defense against centralized backdoors could not recognize distributed backdoors.

			The objective of this study is to use Educational Data Mining (EDM) techniques to discover principal factors that affect students’ academic performance. We crawled a dataset from the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS) with 10,279 samples, then by clustering student-related and parents-related variables into three categories: demographic and family background information (Demographic), self-perceived willingness for education (Willingness), perceived family interaction (Interaction), we implemented various EDM methodologies such as linear regression, regression tree, and random forest on the dataset. As the first attempt to conduct a comprehensive and quantitative investigation into the principal factors that influence Chinese junior high school students’ academic performance on a nationally representative survey, this study not only summarizes, explains, and compares different principal factors discovered by different EDM techniques, but also provides some insight for mitigating China’s educational inequality.

			<div class="project_description">
			This study aims at developing a pragmatic solution for intelligent garbage recycling that can be deployed on portable, real-time, and energy-efficient edge-computing devices. We proposed a novel YOLO-based neural network model with Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to increase the accuracy of classification, accelerate the speed of calculation, and reduce the model size to make it feasible in the real-world garbage recycling scenario. The model is consisted of a convolutional feature extractor, a convolutional predictor, and a decoder. After the training process, this model can achieve a correct rate of 69.70% with a total number of 32.1 million parameters and a speed of processing 60 Frames Per Second (FPS), surpassing the performance of other existing models such as YOLO v1 and Fast R-CNN.

			This project gives a solution to Problem A of the 2020 Mathematical Contest in Modeling, and was awarded Meritorious Winner Prize (top 6% among 13,749 teams). To model the potential migration and fishing of Scottish mackerel and herring, we predicted the change of the North Atlantic sea temperature based on three authoritative datasets by Holt-Winter’s seasonal forecasting method, realized data visualization through heatmaps, and utilized a probabilistic method to simulate the potential future habitats of Scottish mackerel and herring by Markov process. Finally, based on the estimated migration of Scottish mackerel and herring, we developed an economic model to predict future fishing profits by cost-benefit analysis.
